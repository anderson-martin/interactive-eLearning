# interactive-eLearning


Apprix Oy is specialized in providing interatcive applications to big companies, by which they can educate their employees. As hobby, I have recreated one of their sample apps by JavaScript and made it responsive (Orginal app was in FLash and non-responsive). Eventhough,  this app is tiny but it's highly interactive and it took me some time to create it. You can see it live in here: http://interactive-elearning.herokuapp.com

With help of this app, users should fill out the blank spaces and then answer to the correspondent quiz (each blank space has it's own quiz). Drag & dropping the answers is possible in tablets & mobile devices too, however, to get the best experience, it's recommended that users access the application from a dekstop system. 


I have done this app, to challenge my front-end skill. That's why I haven't used any server side language nor database for design of this application. It's written in CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery and jQuery UI. However, for deployment on Heroku, I have used Rack which is Ruby webserver interface.
