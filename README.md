# interactive-eLearning


I created an interactive & responsive eLearning application with JavaScript. Eventhough,  this app is tiny but it's highly interactive and it took me some time to create it. You can see it live under following link (please use Google Chrome to get best result) : http://interactive-elearning.herokuapp.com

With help of this app, users should fill out the blank spaces and then answer to the correspondent quiz (each blank space has it's own quiz). Drag & dropping the answers is possible in tablets & mobile devices too, however, to get the best experience, it's recommended that users access the application from a dekstop system. 


I have done this app, to challenge my front-end skill. That's why I haven't used any server side language nor database for design of this application. It's written in CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery and jQuery UI. However, for deployment on Heroku, I have used Rack which is Ruby webserver interface.

Following screenshots explain the functionality:


In page 2, users should drag answers and drop them in the correct place. To get best experience, it's recommended to access the app from desktop devices.

After dropping each answer and it's correct place, three true/false questions pop up in row, each followed by the correct answer. So, user can challenge his knowledge.

Disclaimer: content & deisgn of this app was originally developed by Apprix company. It was non-resposvie and in FLash, so I recreated it.
